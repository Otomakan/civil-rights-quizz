Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1] was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous (9\xe2\u20ac\u201c0) decision stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\" and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II (349 U.S. 294 (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed.",wikiLink:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education"},{question:"What was the outcome of the murder trial of Emmet Till?",answers:[{content:"The two defendents were given life in prison",type:!1},{content:"The two defendents were given the death sentence",type:!1},{content:"The two defends were acquitted by an all white jury",type:!0},{content:"The two defendents were fled Mississippi before the trial",type:!1}],postAnswer:"In September 1955, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of Till's kidnapping and murder.
